# Credit-Risk-Project

 Introduction : 
 Credit risk refers to the likelihood of a borrower/customer failing to repay a loan, leading to potential financial losses for the lender. When financial institutions extend services like mortgages, credit cards, or personal loans, there exists an inherent risk that the borrower may default on their repayment obligations. To evaluate this risk, factors like credit history, repayment capacity, loan terms, and annual income can be considered.

 The Main aim of this project is to build the predictive model which can predict the loan status
where class 1 indicate loan is default and class 0 indicate loan is non default

Objective:
 Many financial institutions, evaluate the credit risk of their existing and forthcoming customers. with the technologies like machine learning, organizations can analyze customer data to establish a risk profile. And by using this lender takes a decision to approving or denying loan applications.
